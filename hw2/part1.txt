1. "If an air bubble is detected, the device shall raise an alarm on
    the operator interface and transition to IDLE mode"

    Propositional Variables
        P = "An air buble is detected"
        Q = "The device raises an alarm on the operator interface"
        R = "The next Mode is IDLE Mode"

    Logical Formalization of Requirement:
        P -> (Q ^ R)

2a. "The device is in PATIENT BOLUS sub mode only when it is in ACTIVE mode"

    Propositional Variables
        P = "The device is in PATIENT BOLUS sub mode"
        Q = "The device is in ACTIVE mode"

    Logical Formalization of Requirement:
        P -> Q

2b. We could not use "if and only if" because there exists two other possible
    sub modes while the device is in ACTIVE MODE:
        1. SQUARE BOLUS sub mode
        2. BASAL sub mode
    So the device being in ACTIVE mode does not necessarily imply the device
    WILL be in PATIENT BOLUS sub mode. But if the device is in PATIENT BOLUS
    sub mode, then the device HAS to be in ACTIVE mode. If and only if usually
    imply a bi-implication. And (P -> Q) != (P <-> Q)

3.  Propositional Variables
        P = "The device infuses at the basal rate f"
        Q = "The device is in the BASAL submode"

    Logical Formalization of Requirement:
        (P -> Q) ^ (Q -> P)
        OR
        P <-> Q (P bi-implies Q)

4.  "If the device is in Active Mode, it is either in the BASAL sub mode, SQUARE
     BOLUS sub mode or PATIENT BOLUS sub mode"

     Propositional Variables
        P = "The device is in ACTIVE Mode"
        Q = "The device is in BASAL sub mode"
        R = "The device is in SQUARE BOLUS sub mode"
        S = "The device is in PATIENT BOLUS sub mode"

     Logical Formalization of Requirement:
        P -> (Q V R V S) ^ ~(Q ^ R) ^ ~(Q ^ S) ^ ~(S ^ R)

        If the device is in ACTIVE Mode, then it is in BASAL or SQUARE or PATIENT BOLUS submode,
        but not more than 1 at time.

5.  "When the patient bolus button is pressed and the device is in Active Mode
     and the lockout interval is not in effect, the device shall transition to
     PATIENT BOLUS sub mode unless it is in SQUARE BOLUS sub mode."

     Propositional Variables
        P = "Patient bolus button is pressed"
        Q = "Device in Active Mode"
        R = "Lockout interval is in effect"
        S = "The device is in SQUARE BOLUS sub mode"
        T = "Next mode is PATIENT BOLUS sub mode"

     Logical Formalization of Requirements:
        (P ^ Q ^ ~R ^ ~S) -> T

6a. P -> (Q ^ R)

    If an air bubble is detected, then the device raises an alarm on the operator interface and
    next mode is IDLE mode

6b. P -> Q

    If the device is in PATIENT BOLUS sub mode, then the device is in ACTIVE Mode.

6c. (P -> Q) ^ (Q -> P)

    If the device infuses at the basal rate f, then the device is in the BASAL sub mode and if the
    device is in BASAL sub mode, then the device infuses at the basal rate.

    OR

    P <-> Q

    The device infuses at the basal rate f if and only if the device is in the BASAL sub mode.

6d. P -> (Q V R V S) ^ ~(Q ^ R) ^ ~(Q ^ S) ^ ~(S ^ R)

    If the device is in ACTIVE Mode, then the device is in BASAL sub mode or SQUARE BOLUS sub mode
    or PATIENT BOLUS sub mode and not both BASAL sub mode and SQUARE BOLUS sub mode and not both
    BASAL sub mode and PATIENT BOLUS sub mode and not both PATIENT BOLUS sub mode and SQUARE BOLUS
    sub mode.
